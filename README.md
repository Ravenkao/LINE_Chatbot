# Chatbot for Toronto Young Professionals Community
This community was created to bring together young people in Toronto to network, travel, and make friends, with no restrictions on nationality or background.

- User Size: 50+ (2024)
- Pain Point: New members often struggle to find information about the group’s latest activities. To avoid repeatedly explaining the same details, a system was designed to provide group information whenever someone joins.
- Product: Application Based on [LINE Chatbot](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot/)
- Future Plan: Develop a real-time translation chatbot with an optional feature to prevent excessive messages from overwhelming the user experience.
